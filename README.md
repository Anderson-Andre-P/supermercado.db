# supermercado.db

This repository contains a project focused on creating and querying a database using SQLite and Google Colab. The project involved several steps, including creating tables, populating tables, and querying tables using SQL statements.

The data was stored in a SQLite database, which provides a lightweight and efficient way to store and manage structured data. The project utilized Google Colab, which is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that allows for easy collaboration and sharing of code.

The project started with creating tables using SQL statements, defining the table structure, and specifying the data types for each column. Once the tables were created, data was inserted into the tables using SQL statements. The project also included querying the data using SQL statements, retrieving data from one or more tables based on certain criteria.

The project attempted to create procedures using SQL statements to automate common tasks, but due to limitations in Google Colab, it was not fully implemented.

Overall, this project serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about databases and SQL. The use of Google Colab provides an easy-to-use and accessible platform for learning and practicing database skills. The project also provides a solid foundation for anyone interested in pursuing a career in data analysis or database management.
